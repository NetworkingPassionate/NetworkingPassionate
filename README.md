<h2>üí¨ About Me</h2>

## üëã About Me

Hi there! I'm Connor ‚Äî a detail-driven tech enthusiast with a passion for hands-on cybersecurity, and network engineering.

After earning a **DDM BTEC National Diploma in Information Technology**, I spent **three years studying at the University of South Wales**, focusing on topics that sharpened both my technical depth and problem-solving mindset. My academic background laid the foundation for my self-led exploration into network security, SIEM log analysis, firewall testing, and automation.

In between packet captures and Python scripts, you'll find me immersed in strategy as an **avid chess player**, working as a **carer**, and designing signage as part of my day job in **Cardiff**. My portfolio reflects a blend of creativity, precision, and professional polish ‚Äî whether it's documentation, scripting tools, or technical walkthroughs.

I use this space to showcase real-world labs, write-ups, and curated demos that highlight my growth, curiosity, and commitment to becoming a well-rounded NetSec professional.

Let's connect ‚Äî and feel free to explore the projects above!





Here are some ideas to get you started:

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on completing my Cisco **CCNA**, and **Comptia+ Security** Certificates
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning Spanish! This will be a huge gift for me, and hopefully a start to me learning many other languages
- üì´ How to reach me: üìß connor.palmer16@outlook.com üì± 07340474681
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I hope to complete the Cancer Research U.K. race for life in 2026!
